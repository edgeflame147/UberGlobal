# UberGlobal
**Inspiration**
Our inspiration for Transport Router comes from our own elementary school days, when we first started carpooling with classmates to and from school every day, purely out of convenience for our parents, without ever really realizing its environmental and social impact.

Now, as the world continues to progress everyday, and the problem described only becomes more obvious, we’ve begun to appreciate seemingly unimportant rideshares, all leading to this final product.

**Problem**
The widespread use of cars, although convenient and efficient, have major drawbacks including contributing to pollution, causing traffic jams, and diminishing public transportation options for those who rely on it, such as people with disabilities, of low-income, and of old age. 

**Goal**
To address these problems, Transport Router aims to create an accessible interface that promotes environmental preservation and streamlines the user’s driving experience. 

**Project Process**

Initial Planning Process
  - brainstormed all our ideas and goals for the project
  - 
Programming
  - next, we split up to create individual pieces of code and algorithms for individual parts of the project
    
Putting it together
  - we put all our pieces together into our website

**Project Features**
  - Feedback feature for certain drivers 
  - Map of the area 
  - Ability to request rides

**Challenges**
  - Coming up with all of our ideas
  - Putting all of our ideas together into one cohesive product
  - Time management and finishing everything at a reasonable pace
